# NBFM_Repeater
Simple NBFM RepeaterSDR with ADALM PLUTO based on GNURadio python 3.

Feature system developement:
- AGC control
- CTCSS decode
- CTCSS busy TX
- Used GPO3 Pluto for driver RF power amplifier frontend
- Linear BF ouput 50-3000hz

It's possible change Paramenter on .ini file or small GUI interface.
I hope this project can be an inspiration for someone and can grow and become something more.
